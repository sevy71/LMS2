        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
          Pick one team each round. If your team wins, you go through. If it loses or draws, you’re out.
          You can’t pick the same team more than once in a cycle. The goal is simple: be the last player left.
          If you’re the only active player after a round finishes, you win the game.

        <h5>Game Length & Cycles</h5>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li>Each cycle has up to 20 rounds.</li>
          <li>Winner: If exactly one player is still active at the end of any round, they win. A new game then starts with all players active and all 20 teams available again.</li>
          <li>All out: If every player is eliminated in a round, a new game starts with all players active and all 20 teams available.</li>
          <li>End of cycle: If Round 20 finishes and at least two players are still active, a new cycle starts with only those active players. They get all 20 teams available again.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5>Round Eligibility</h5>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li>A round only goes ahead if every active player has at least one eligible team to pick (eligible = playing this round and not already used in the current cycle).</li>
          <li>For better choice early on, we aim for: up to Round 10, usually 3+ options per player; Rounds 11–20, usually 2+ options. This is guidance only—the round still goes ahead as long as everyone has at least one option.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="card mb-3">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5>Missed Picks (Auto-Pick)</h5>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li>If a player misses the deadline, an auto-pick is applied:</li>
          <li class="mt-2"><strong>Order</strong>: (1) Walk the player’s past picks from most recent to oldest and take the opposing team (the loser in that past match) if eligible this round; if none, (2) assign the first eligible team alphabetically among teams not yet used this cycle.</li>
          <li>No eligible team should not occur under round eligibility. If late fixture changes cause it, a bye may be granted at admins’ discretion.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5>Postponements</h5>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li>Use the round’s first kickoff time as reference.</li>
          <li><strong>Early (≥ 60 min before first kickoff)</strong>: Player may re-pick; original team does not count as used. To qualify, the original pick must have been made before the official postponement announcement and at least 120 min before first kickoff.</li>
          <li><strong>Late (&lt; 60 min before first kickoff or after kickoff)</strong>: Player receives a bye to the next round; the originally picked team counts as used.</li>
          <li>Same rules apply to auto-picked teams. We notify affected players and record the reason.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="card mb-4">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5>Special Measures</h5>
        <p class="mb-0">
          In unusual circumstances (e.g., widespread postponements), admins may apply special measures such as a universal bye, freezing or voiding a round, or overriding outcomes with a note for transparency.
